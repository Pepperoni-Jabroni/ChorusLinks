Chorus Links is a vanilla friendly teleportation mod using Chorus Fruits!

Chorus Links features & details:
- Adds 2 new items: Golden Chorus Fruit & Enchanted Golden Chorus Fruit
   - Crafted by surrounding a Chorus Fruit with Gold Ingots or Gold Blocks respectively
- Adds 1 new block: Chorus Link
   - Crafted by surrounding a Netherite Ingot with Purpur Blocks
- If a Chorus Fruit is consumed within 128 blocks of a Chorus Link (configurable), the player will always be teleported to the top of the Chorus Link.
- When multiple Chorus Links are within radius, the closest is always chosen.
   - When strongly powered, a Chorus Link will not be chosen for teleportation when consuming Chorus Fruits. This means you can select which Chorus Link is chosen using Redstone.
- Golden Chorus Fruits do the same across any distance *in the same dimension*
- Enchanted Golden Chorus Fruit, after being bound (by using/right-clicking on a Chorus Link), will teleport the player to the bounded Chorus Link from any distance  *and across dimensions*. If unbounded, they function the same as a Golden Chorus Fruit. They get 8 uses until they're fully consumed.
